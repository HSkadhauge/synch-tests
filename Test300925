                <v3:text lang="en" country="GB">Nordic Doctoral Summit for Research on Entrepreneurship Education (NDSREE) will be an annual event aimed at bringing together doctoral students from the Nordic
countries. NDSREE will launch in 2024 with an event establishing the summit as
an institution. The purpose is to bring together the growing amount of Nordic
PhD Students in the field of entrepreneurship education to facilitate:
 * Professional networking amongst doctoral students in Nordic countries
 * Collaborative and peer development of papers, research projects and academic
   careers
 * An intensive course program where senior scholars are invited to give
   feedback, updated research knowledge and input to the ongoing PhD projects
 * Advance knowledge and research in the field of management, entrepreneurship,
   innovation by formulating joint research projects and applications
 * Introduce doctoral students to the various communities within
   entrepreneurship education
 * Organize an event where socializing and informal work brings scholars in the
   field closer together


The overall goal is to contribute to the development of doctoral students and
early career academics in the field of entrepreneurship education. The
NDSREE-event will be organized in relation to one of the two conference centers
owned by “Danish – Norwegian Culture Foundation” in either Oslo or Copenhagen
(see http://dansk-norsk.no/sok-stipend).</v3:text>
